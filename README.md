# Geocache Puzzlebox

A **Geocache Puzzlebox** inspired by Sean Hodgins' excellent [Arduino Geocache Locator](https://hackaday.io/project/201716-geocache-puzzlebox). This project was created for a bucks night to facilitate a walking puzzle crawl in Sydney, combining a NeoPixel ring and a GPS module to create a compass that leads you to specific locations (pubs, in our case).

## Usage

1. Power on the device.
2. Follow the NeoPixel compass to the destination.
3. Solve the puzzle at the location to uncover a binary code.
4. Enter the binary code to unlock the next destination.
5. Repeat until the final destination is reached.
